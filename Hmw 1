#Write a program that counts from 1 to 50, for every number check if any of the following conditions are met, 
#if so print that the condition is true:
#number is odd
#number is smaller than 3
#number is bigger than 49 
#number is divisible by 4 
#number is 45 
#bonus: number is a prime number (divisible by one and itself)
list1 = list(range(1, 51))
#print(list1)

for number in list1:
    if number % 2 == 0: # if the number is odd
        print(True)
    elif number < 3: # if it is smaller than 3
        print(True)
    elif number > 49: # bigger than 49
        print(True)
    elif number % 4 == 0: # divisible by 4
        print(True) # (f" {number} divisible by 4")
    elif number == 45: # is 45
        print(True)
    # To check whether or not a number is prime we need 2 conditions:
    # 1st condition: 0, 1, even numbers greater than 2 are NOT prime
    elif number == 1 or number == 0 or (number % 2 == 0 and number > 2):
        pass
    # 2nd condition: not prime is divisible by another number less or equal to the square root of itself.
    # number**(1/2) returns square root of n
    else:
        for i in range(3, int(number ** (1 / 2)) + 1, 2):
          if (number % i) == 0:
            print(number)  # (f" {number} is not a prime") # Just to check whether it is a prime
          else:
            print(True)
